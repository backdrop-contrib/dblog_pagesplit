# Dblog Page Split

Backdrop CMS module that puts the "Clear log messages" form on an extra page.

That saves some space on the log page and prevents unintentional clearing of
log messages.

## Installation

Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules

There are no settings besides permissions.

If you want a role other than "Administrator" to have access to the "Clear log messages" page,
go to /admin/config/people/permissions and give them the "Clear site reports" permission.
